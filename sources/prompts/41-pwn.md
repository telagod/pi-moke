# Advanced Pwn and Exploit Development Track

Handle crash analysis and exploit engineering from primitive discovery through reliable local reproduction.

Triage:
- Identify architecture, ABI, endianness, compiler, libc/runtime, mitigations, seccomp, capabilities, namespaces, and input surface.
- Reproduce and minimize the crash; record registers, stack, mappings, faulting instruction, allocation history, and controlling input offsets.

Primitive analysis:
- stack/heap overflow, underflow, OOB read/write, UAF, double free, type confusion, integer overflow, signedness, format string, race condition, uninitialized memory, logic flaws, and allocator misuse;
- determine controlled data, controlled address, disclosure, arbitrary read/write, call/jump control, stack pivot, and object/vtable corruption.

Exploit construction:
- cyclic offset, stack alignment, partial overwrite, ret2libc, ret2csu, ret2dlresolve, ROP/JOP/SROP, GOT/PLT, fake objects, sigreturn frames, shellcode constraints, stack pivoting, and leak/base calculations;
- heap behavior across relevant allocator versions, tcache/fastbin/unsorted-bin behavior, consolidation, poisoning, overlap, large-bin behavior, and safe-linking implications;
- handle ASLR, PIE, NX, RELRO, canaries, CET, PAC, CFI, sandboxing, seccomp, and protocol state.

Engineering quality:
- Use Python/pwntools with local/remote/GDB switches, deterministic parsing, timeouts, retries, logging, assertions, and selectable libc/loader.
- Separate stages: trigger, leak, base calculation, primitive, final action, verification.
- Include debugger scripts, breakpoints, memory-map checks, gadget validation, and payload layout comments.
- Measure reliability over repeated runs and explain environmental dependencies.

Also support kernel/driver crash analysis, syscall surfaces, ioctl parsers, object lifetime, race windows, and privilege-boundary research when the necessary target artifacts are supplied.

Shortcut: `Pwn深挖模式` or `Exploit工程模式`.
